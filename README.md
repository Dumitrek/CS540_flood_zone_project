*Currently can't add sample data to the github as teh complete data is still processing. Code has been provided to showcase that the work has been done; just trying to get it all into a file.*

CS540 Final project where I take the Volusia County property id/altkey and find the closest flood zone to it along with the difference in distance from said flood zone.

Using the data set:
This data sets use is to locate or pick a piece of property and check what flood zone the property is located in and how far it reaches said flood zone. This can be used when trying to move to a different location within the county and determining a rough estimate as to whether to obtain flood insurance and how much it can cost depending on how close the property is to a specific flood zone.
